    <p class="intro_paragraph">Hi! My name is Noah Rothgaber. I'm 25 and a Computer Science senior (I think) here at the
        University of Massachusetts Lowell. I am from Salem, NH, and transferred here from Northern Essex Community
        College. I am a musician (drums), a robotics research assistant at the NERVE Center in Lowell, and a dad to two
        crazy pups and a number of other pets.

    <p class="intro_paragraph">
        A huge passion of mine since the very beginning has been music. I have been playing drums since I was 8 years
        old and am thankful to have had the opportunity to play with hundreds of different musicians across the southern
        New Hampshire area.
    </p>
    <p class="intro_paragraph">
        I have played in a number of original bands, such as the local-to-Lowell band Out Of Water, as
        well as a professional Led Zeppelin tribute band called Four Symbols. Apart from that, I play in the graduation
        band at Northern Essex Community College and was a member of my middle school's jazz band. I was also featured
        in a
        number of single-song performances for Mojo's Music in Salem, New Hampshire, and the Music Workshop (now
        closed), also
        in Salem.

                the hardest collection of music I have ever had to play. I am taking a break for the remainder of my

        I got into programming kind of late in my education. After getting my HiSET (GED) diploma, I initially opted to
        go into Information Technology as my major. I knew I liked computers, but the first person I spoke to at my
        school asked me, "Okay, you like computers. Well... do you like math?" Of course, I answered how any person who
        didn't finish high school would answer that question: "NO!" This person ruled out Computer Science for me and
        sent me on a path toward IT.
    </p>
    <p class="intro_paragraph">
        While on this IT path, I had to take a required programming class for Python.
        Right there, in what seemed on the surface to be a huge pain of a class, my love for programming was sparked,
        which led me to where I am today!
    </p>
    <p class="intro_paragraph">
        Below are some of the projects I am proud of. The primary languages I use are Python, Bash, and Arduino C as of
        now.

                Structures class in Java and my first C++ course, so this tool could open a templated Word document or
                any of the IDEs I was using at the time. It also features a poorly constructed GUI in Java Swing, which
                shows why I need this class ASAP!

                This was the culmination of all my newly found passion for programming from that infamous
                "Programming for IT" class. I
                spent hours on this project before the class even started. I told myself I'd do everything I could to
                get a good grade for that class, and I knew the final was a "Show me what you know" style assignment. I
                was beyond proud of how it came out at the time, but I hope my current code shows just how far I've come
                since then.
